===INSTALLATION===
Installation is a three step process.  You must upload bitcoin_update.php, you must modify index.php and you must credit coindesk.
  
STEP 1) Upload bitcoin_update.php:
Place bitcoin_update.php in the folder [OpenCart]/catalog/controller/common

STEP 2) Modify index.php:
Add the following lines to the index.php file in the base directory of your Opencart installation.

After:
// SEO URL's
$controller->addPreAction(new Action('common/seo_url'));	

Add:
// Update Currencies
$controller->addPreAction(new Action('common/bitcoin_update'));

STEP3) Credit coindesk
Each page that uses this extension must include the text “Powered by CoinDesk“ and link to http://www.coindesk.com/price/
I recommend doing this in the footer.tpl of your theme.


Enjoy!
